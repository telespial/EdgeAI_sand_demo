failsafe/FAILSAFE_2026-02-14_v31_hud_top_left_boot_visible_4b59071.elf
Last-resort firmware image from commit 4b59071 built with EDGEAI_ENABLE_NPU_INFERENCE=1 and EDGEAI_NPU_BACKEND=1 (Neutron): dune background + silver ball with shadow/trails; HUD status moved to top-left and rendered at startup without ball-overlap dependency.
